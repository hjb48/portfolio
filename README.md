The program puppyScrape is a python script I wrote for personal use to scrape a particular website every 10 seconds for puppy listings that match my criteria. This was necessitated by the increased demand for puppies due to everyone being at home in quarantine. If a match is found, it sends a text message and email to alert me. After I got a puppy using the app, I changed the code to work with a json file that held multiple user criteria and do searches for multiple people at the same time.

Spyfawl is a game I made to play with my friends that is basically a rebuilt version of the game Spyfall, where everyone except one person has a role at a shared location, and the group goes around asking questions to determine who was not given a role or location (the "spy"). My app takes player information used for identification and text messagin, and allows for making custom locations and roles (this is why I made it, we exhausted the library of locations that comes with the game). When you start a round, a location is chosen and everyone except the spy is texted the location and a role for that specific location.

The last thing to share is the website I was a developer for from my freshman design project. It is a craigslist-like forum meant exclusively for Drexel students.
